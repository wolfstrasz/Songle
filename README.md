# Songle
An Android Application (GAME)
Done in Android Studio (in Java)

The game is about going around a map using a players location and collecting different words from the map (similar to the Pokemon GO game). 
The game has levels with different difficulty. Each level is a Song that has to be guessed and the words collected from the maps are its lyrics. Players must collect those lyrics, guess songs, earn hint points and use the hint points to buy hints for harder level songs.

The project includes different elements:
+ Online database
+ Google maps API
+ Network Connections
+ XML layouts (Light and Dark)
+ Object-Oriented
